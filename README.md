First, I researched YAML, its functions, and its features.
 Then, I inquired about linking different repositories. I discovered that this can be done using submodules in the main repository. 
 Additionally, I found that creating workspaces in the repositories enables this linkage. 
 Throughout this process, I faced many challenges, one of which was figuring out how to set permissions to allow automatic pushes. 
 I tried to solve these challenges by searching and reading documentation. Lastly, I explored how to allow users to push to the repository and have the main repository automatically pull the changes.
